This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Kotlin code involving integer parsing and error handling.  The `processData` function attempts to parse a comma-separated string into two integers and add them. It includes a check for the correct number of parts but fails to explicitly handle cases where a part is not a valid integer, returning an unhelpful "Invalid input" message.  The `bugSolution.kt` file provides a corrected version that offers more robust error handling.
